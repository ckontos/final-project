### Description
This application is a  full stack application with a front end constructed using HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework. The backend constructed with Node.js and Express connecting to mongoDB for a news feed, Sequelize for user authentication and firebase for photo storage. 

The user may create an account which stores their location to be rendered in searches. Once a user creates an account they can search for other users within the proximity they define, who play select instruments or are searching for new members to join a band. The user may also search by username. Once a search has been performed the user is shown all users within their network who meet the parameters of the search.
